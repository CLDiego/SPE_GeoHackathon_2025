# SPE GeoHackathon 2025 – Bootcamp on LLMs and RAG for Geosciences

## Overview
The bootcamp aims to provide participants with a practical understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, specifically tailored for geoscience applications. Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples, participants will learn how to effectively leverage these advanced AI technologies in their research and projects.

### What You'll Learn
- Fundamentals of LLMs and RAG
- Leverage open-source tools and frameworks built for LLMs e.g. Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, Gradio
- Implement LLMs and RAG in geoscience use cases
- Evaluation of model performance and effectiveness
- Best practices for deploying LLMs in production environments

## Getting Started
1. ✅ Recommended Platform: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): Colab provides a free, GPU-enabled environment—ideal for this bootcamp. 
2. 🤗 HuggingFace account: Create a free account at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join) to access pre-trained models and datasets.
3. 🤗 HuggingFace API token: After creating your account, obtain your API token from the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
4. Getting access to Llama (optional): If you wish to test out the capabilities of Meta's LLaMA model, you can request access through the [official form](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct). Getting approved for access might take some time, so please **request it in ADVANCE**.

**Important to note** 
- Most of the models we'll be using are quite large and require significant computational resources.
Wait times for model loading and inference can be substantial, so please be patient. This is normal!
- Google Colab has some limitations, such as a maximum session duration and idle timeouts. Make sure to save your work frequently.
- Although we can fit many tasks within the Colab environment, extremely large models or datasets may exceed the available resources and may require a Google Colab Pro account. If you have access to a heavy compute environment, you may also consider using that, just keep in mind the potential differences in setup and configuration.

### What You Need

* A Google account
* Reliable internet connection

## Running the Notebooks

1. Open the GitHub repo, and navigate to any of the available notebooks.
2. Click the “Open in Colab” badge (if available), or:
   * Download the notebook locally.
   * Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   * Use **File > Upload Notebook** to run it.

#### Enable GPU in Colab

1. **Runtime > Change runtime type**
2. Set **Hardware Accelerator** to `GPU`
3. Click **Save**
